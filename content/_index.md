# Hi, I'm Mac!

I'm a software engineer with a passion for complex, high-performance software, like game engines, compilers and operating systems.

Right now, I'm working on [richter], an implementation of the Quake engine in Rust using modern design principles and engine architecture.
You can find me on my social media and around the Rust graphics and game dev communities.
It's nice to meet you!
