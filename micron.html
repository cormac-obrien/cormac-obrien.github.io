<h1>MICRON: A Simple Programming Language</h1>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>I would like to...</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h2>Lexical Analysis</h2>

<h3>Lines</h3>

<p>MICRON programs are divided into logical lines, each separated by a NEWLINE
token. A logical line can span multiple physical lines, which are separated by
an ASCII line feed.</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>MICRON uses C-style comments. Comments begin at <code>/*</code> and end at <code>*/</code>.</p>

<pre><code>/* This is a comment. */

/* This is also *
 * a comment.   */
</code></pre>

<p>There are no single-line comments in MICRON.</p>

<h3>Encoding</h3>

<p>UTF-8 is the sole encoding supported by MICRON.</p>

<h3>Line Joining</h3>

<p>Lines in MICRON may be explicitly joined by placing a backslash <code>\</code> at the end
of a line.</p>

<pre><code>if x == 5 \
  and y == 6:
    /* do something */
</code></pre>

<p>MICRON implicitly joins lines inside delimiters. This means that array and
struct definitions can span multiple lines.</p>

<h3>Indentation</h3>

<p>MICRON uses spaces for indentation. Hard tabs should not appear in source code.
One level of indentation is four spaces. Indentation is the method for
determining blocking/scoping. Anonymous scoping is permitted simply by indenting
four spaces and dedenting when the block should be finished.</p>

<h2>Keywords, Identifiers and Literals</h2>

<h3>Keywords</h3>

<p>The following words are reserved as keywords and may not be used for any other
purpose.</p>

<pre><code>and do elif else fn for if import not or struct while
</code></pre>

<h3>Literals</h3>

<h4>Numbers</h4>

<h4>Strings</h4>

<h3>Operators</h3>

<p>MICRON's operators are as follows.</p>

<pre><code>+   -   *   /   %
&lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;  &amp;   |   ^   ~
&lt;   &gt;   &lt;=  &gt;=  ==  !=
</code></pre>

<h3>Delimiters</h3>

<p>MICRON's delimiters are as follows.</p>

<pre><code>(   )   {   }   [   ]
</code></pre>
